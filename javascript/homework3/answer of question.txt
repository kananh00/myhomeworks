Question:
 
  All objects in JavaScript come from the parent Object constructor. We can use many built-in methods in object, and it gives a chance to us working with our individual objects.
Object method is used on the object constructor and as a parametr it uses object instance. With help of object methods we can modify, protect, and repeat through them.
